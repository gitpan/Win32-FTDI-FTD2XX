RTS# FTD2XX-1.02-01
-------------------
Description:
There is currently no way to free and reopen an FT_HANDLE through the
FTD2XX object after a CyclePort() operation, without DESTROYING the whole
object and reinstanciating.

Status: 
Complete

Patch Detail:
Modified P5FTD2XX.DLL PFT_CyclePort() interface to properly release the
trashed FT_HANDLE. However, the inherent behavior of the device after a
CyclePort requires a wait period of 4-8 seconds, depending on your system,
for the device to recover. Any API call that talks directly to a device,
like GetSerialByIndex(), will fail with FT_INVALID_HANDLE if the application
doesn't take the wait period into account. This was not done in the API Method
so as not to block the main perl thread during the recovery time. Other bus
manipulating API calls like Rescan() also seem to require this restabilization
period.
